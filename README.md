# LineerRegressionCase
In this project, I will build a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. I will investigate three different approaches to this problem. I will use NumPy and Scikit-Learn linear regression models, as well as construct and optimize the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.
